00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:10,480
Welcome to 

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:15,680
problem number three of practice four at 
the Institute of Particle and Nuclear Physics, 
where 

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,400
we're going to measure the characteristic 

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,760
radiation 

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,519
of metals, the characteristic spectrum, 
and we're going to try 

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,640

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,840
to identify these metals with this. In 
addition, we'll also try to 

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,559
determine the 

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,079
mass or volume 

11
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:40,760
composition in a multi-element alloy for 
one or two samples.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,400
For this we need a 

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,160
radiator, we'll use 

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,559
[Music] 

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,160
americium. For that we need samples, 
we 

16
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,680
they are numbered, and for that 

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,039
we need 

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,320
a detector 

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,720
that is cooled by liquid nitrogen 

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,280
and that 

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:13,159
is sensitive just 

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,159
to the expected spectrum of 

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,159

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,079
X-ray energies. So one of the zero steps 

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,840
is to calibrate the whole apparatus. 

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,400
For this purpose,

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:36,560
we place the source directly 

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,680
next to the detector and delay it 

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,439
to reduce its too high 

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,719
intensity in our case. In this 

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,000
setup, we take a characteristic 

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,840
spectrum and 

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,479
using a 

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,240
known distribution or a known 

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,360
spectrum of the element 

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,799
americium, we detect some 

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,799
characteristic lines and we 

38
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,879
calibrate the software according to them, 
not to measure channel numbers 
corresponding to some 

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
energy, but to 

40
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,640
assign some 

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,720
energy to those channel numbers. The 
other thing that is important to know is 
that 

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,840
atoms, when they jump from one level to 

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,440
another, they 

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,599
emit 

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,280
some energy when they are excited. To 
help us 

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,040
make sense of this, 

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,920
the emitted bands or jumps are 

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,319
by default labelled in some way. Letter K 
duck to mark the 

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,840
denotes transition 

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,080
from any level to the K level. When we 

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,280
add the K_alpha, K_beta marking, the 

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:05,360
K_alpha is from the first higher, that is, 
from L, 

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:09,159
to K. When we put beta, it is from M to K. 
When we 

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,480
label the line as L, it is a 

55
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:16,560
jump from some higher energy 

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,720
level to L. And again, alpha, beta 

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,480
indicates to us whether it is from the 
first 

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,959
closest level, from M, or from the next 
higher, from 

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,280
N, and so 

60
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:37,000
on. What's important to note next is that 

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,319

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,760
there's generally a dependency between 
K_alpha and K_beta. Depending on the 

63
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:49,820
atomic number, the ratio of the number of 

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,120
occurrences between alpha and beta 

65
00:03:49,820 --> 00:04:00,040

66 00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:05,879
is given and varies between zero and 
0.3. 

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:11,040
In any case, the occurrence of alpha lines 

68
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,680
is significantly higher than that of beta 
lines. 

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,239
That is, the most frequent transitions that 

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,120
we register are alpha, then beta, 

71
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,840
at a ratio of one to three or worse. 
Another important thing to 

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,080
note is that the most common 

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:32,440
transition we register is the K transition, 

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,280
that is, to the ground 

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,160
level. The frequency of transitions to the L 
level and to the 

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,080
next level is again 

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,800
lower. So that's to some relation between 

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,000
the different surfaces. Then it is 
important that we 

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,560
have the tables. For each element 

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,280
with its atomic number, we have lists of 

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,199
energies at transitions K_alpha, K_beta. 

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,680
Again, there is a further breakdown of 
K_alpha_1, K_alpha_2 

83
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,560
for example, which in turn may be related 
to 

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,960
, for example, different magnetic 

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,240
number of those surfaces or electrons 

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,240
on those surfaces, and so on. Then there's 

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:26,199
maybe an interesting line Edge in the K group, 

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:31,520
Edge for the L group, and so on. That just tells 
us that it's

89
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:35,400
a jump from infinity or from the edge of 
the 

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,639
atoms to a given energy level. That is, 

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:44,720
in other words, it's the excitation energy 
of the electron 

92
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,520
at a given level. The important thing, and 
it's

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,680

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:55,240
good for our orientation in the table, 
to know that those energies go up 

95
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,840
for each line from the element with the 
lower 

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,639
atomic number to the element with the 
highest 

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,280
atomic number, so it's an 

98
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:09,319
ascending series. That is, when we're 

99
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,599
looking for a line or an element and we're 
measuring a 

100
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:17,400
line, what's important. The important 
thing 

101
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:21,599
here is to start looking in K_alpha first. 

102
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:27,039
When we find it, then we also look for 
what is 

103
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:28,759
beyond the line at the location of our 
K_beta. 

104
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,199
When possible, we will of course also look 
at 

105
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,560
the L lines, but they are already 

106
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,880
significantly fainter and may get 

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,440
lost in the noise - depending on how 

108
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,960
sensitive our 

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,400
measuring equipment is. What's further 

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,520
important is, 

111
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,520

112 00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,840
that if we don't find a line 

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,000
corresponding to the beta, then 

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,720
of course we question the correctness of 
the determination of 

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,840
the line in alpha. It may be that we find 
two 

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,440
lines that should match and could 

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,360
match K_alpha, K_beta, but we don't find 

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,599
an element in that location that 

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,560
matches in this. 

120
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:20,960
And then of course another possibility is 
to 

121
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,599
look to see if they are L lines, and 

122
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,199
if we find some match between 

123
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,080
L_alpha, L_beta, we identify the element 
there. Then, 

124
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,879
of course, it's important to think and 

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,960
see why we don't see a K 

126
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:43,520
line. The last thing maybe that's 

127
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,639
good to mention at the beginning is that 
if we follow 

128
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,479
point three to try to plot a graph of 

129
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,599
the dependence of the 

130
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,319
atomic number of the element and the 

131
00:07:52,599 --> 00:08:00,360
yield on that line, 

132
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:03,440
again - we're either plotting the K_alpha 
lines there, 

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,479
or the K_beta lines, or the sum of them. 

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,199
To plot the K_alpha and to 

135
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,840
look and plot the K_beta line of another 

136
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:18,199
element means, of course, to introduce 

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,879
error into the construction of such a 

138
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,840
graph. If we are not sure, we 

139
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,680
can of course plot the sum of K_alpha 

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,639
plus K_beta. Or we can 

141
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,080
separate from the sum, using the 

142
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,039
known distribution of the ratio between 
K_alpha, 

143
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,240
K_beta, we can 

144
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,159
separate the individual 

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,600
element. From a practical point of view, 
and we'll look at this 

146
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,240
later in more detail, 

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,680
it's important to know that those K_alpha 
and K_beta 

148
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,519
lines can 

149
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,079
blend together due to the resolution of the 
detector that we have. They can merge into 
one 

150
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,079
peak. In that case, of course, it's hard 
to 

151
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,000
separate it by measurement. You can split 
it based on 

152
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,959
the 

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,320
relationship between the curves that we 
have, but 

154
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,480
it's probably 

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,399
best to actually plot the sum of 

156
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,959
K_alpha and K_beta. We're actually 
plotting 

157
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,640
the solid 

158
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,480
line. So that would be it for 

159
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,760
practical measurement. Since you can't 

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,959
be here and I can't directly guide you, 
after we've 

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,920
taken the 

162
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,920
spectrum as we 

163
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,720
have it set up here and 

164
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:44,959
identified the 

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,959
americium lines and then calibrated 

166
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,519
the spectroscope, then we take what's 
called a 

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:59,600
reference spectrum where we place the 

168
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:02,760
emitter in the final position where it's

169
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,320
going to be radiating on our sample 

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:12,560
and the radiation from the sample 

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:16,440
is going to be directed to the 

172
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:21,560
detector. And so on. We don't put 

173
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:26,680
any sample in there to begin with, we 
just leave the holder in there, we 

174
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:31,320
set it up, we place it as close to the 

175
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,320
device as possible, being careful not to 
damage anything. 

176 00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,680
We try to

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,680
get as close as possible. So in this 
arrangement, we take a 

178
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:50,200
reference spectrum, which we can then 

179
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,760
subtract from the measured spectra. The 
initial 

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,440
step is to calibrate 

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,600
our detector. Some peaks are 

182
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,040
singlet peaks and some peaks are labeled 

183
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,120
triplets. A triplet means that it is a 

184
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,000
single peak fused together, or it is a 
peak 

185
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,000
split into three subpeaks that may not 

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,920
have the same intensity at all. 

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,760
A peak like this is projected in our 

188
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,800
spectroscope in some way and 

189
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,320
we can't know ahead of time if it's 

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:32,279
shifted in some way. So we'll focus on 
the 

191
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:35,279
simple peaks and mark them. 

192
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,279
The third peak... 

193
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,079
Plus... 

194
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,079
...the beginning... 

195
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,079
...end... 

196
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,680
...done. Let's go to 

197
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Tools... 

198
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,639
Calibration... Clean 

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,639
everything up , add the first peak... 
Centroid... 

200
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,639
...value... 

201
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,000
dot... 

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,959
Five... Add... OK... 

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,240

204 00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,160
And we'll make the calibration visible. Now 

205
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,630
we'll checkmark the triplet peaks that we 
thought 

206
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,630
were inappropriate and suspicious. 

207
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:34,010
Example of peak evaluation, just for the 
information of enthusiasts. 

208
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,010

209 00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:45,160
When looking for features, we have to take into 
account that 

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,920
we can make an error of 0.3 keV, which 

211
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,040
is not related to the accumulated 
statistics, but is 

212
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,920
due to the fact that the peak consists of 

213
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,560
several lines, for example, a triplet, and 
it's not 

214
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,519
uniform, which usually has no reason to 
be, and 

215
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,959
therefore this distorts then the 

216
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,880
resulting 

217
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,000
information. 

218
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,519
Thank you! So, while we're taking the 

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,240
promised reference spectrum, which 

220
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,399
we'll then subtract from the acquired 
signal, 

221
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,399
you can already see that the original 
high

222
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,399
value... 

223
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:33,600

224
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,160
...little bumps where the original peaks 
were, which 

225
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,399
will be good to subtract from 

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,639
the actual spectrum. Thank you! 

227
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,480
Sample #1 

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:51,000
As an example... In addition to sending 
you, then,

229
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:55,519
a little bit of prepared data, we'll now 
take a 

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,519
sample measurement of sample number 

231
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,839
one, which we'll base 

232
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:07,079
on the experimental site. Again, it's 

233
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:12,480
at about a 45-degree angle so that 

234
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:15,880
the emitter is shining on it, and that's 
how we'll place it. 

235
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:21,240
Next, we're going to look at 

236
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:24,680
sample number four, which is interesting,
and sample number five, which 

237
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,079
I'm going to show you something about on 
the monitor. But 

238
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,199
otherwise, this should give you an idea of 

239
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:35,480
what the measurement 

240
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:39,240
involves. Unfortunately, you can't measure 
your own 

241
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,680
data, but I'm going to try to give you 

242
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,959
data measured by us, and you can 

243
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,480
try it yourself and try to 
determine what 

244
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:52,440
sample number one, number two, and so on 
is. 

245
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,079
So now I'm going to take the data for 
sample 

246
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,720
number one and then I'll show you how you 
can 

247
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:03,320
then proceed to the actual identification 
of 

248
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,279
the material of that sample. 

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,959
Thank you! Thank you! So we've got about 
three 

250
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:14,440
minutes of 

251
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:20,199
time left. A spectrum like this, if you 
look, 

252
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:23,800
this part mostly replicates what 

253
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:27,360
we had as a reference spectrum. So then 

254
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,199
in your case, you subtract the reference 

255
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,360
spectrum and you should see 

256
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,959
this nice little peak that I've already 

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,079
marked roughly from these points to 

258
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,880
these points. 

259
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:44,639
How to analyze it further, how to 

260
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:49,160
tell from this peak what element it is. 

261
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:53,279
Here we have a bin listing of that 

262
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:58,240
peak, we have where it started, where 

263
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:01,639
it ended, at what energy it's center of 
gravity, 

264
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,639
8.25 keV, it's already in calibrated 

265
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,639
units, width at half maximum, 

266
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:14,279
some resolution, range, from where, to 
where 

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:18,000
in keV. Gross, that is, the size of the 

268
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:23,079
total - how many events fell there. 

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,959
Net Area, that's the number of elements in 
that 

270
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:31,519
pink highlighted part minus the 

271
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,519
backgroundr. If we hover over there,

272
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,839
under ROI, which stands 

273
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:43,319
for Region of Interest, we'll see 

274
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:48,240
one extra piece of information that we're

275
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:52,880
interested in. And that is Net Life, 
that is the 

276
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,240
number of counts per second, or yield.

277
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,399
This number, the 

278
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:04,160
3,479 and so on, we're still collecting the data, 

279
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:08,079
it tells us how many events per second

280
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,559
is falling to this. It's the 
value that 

281
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:15,160
you'll then plot on the graph in 

282
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,959
problem number 

283
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,559
three. 

284
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:24,160
So, how do we determine that. We take the 
spreadsheet and we 

285
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:28,960
start looking at the K lines. It's 

286
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:33,640
roughly 8.25 keV, so we've 

287
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:38,360
got nickel, copper, and zinc as candidates 

288
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,960
with values for K_alpha around eight, 8.6, 
7.9. 

289
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,039
So we'll start 

290
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,799
one at a time. Mouse over the 

291
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,600
value of 

292
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,039
7.4 

293
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,039
roughly. That's right there. 

294
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,840
And we can see that for the alpha line, 
it's

295
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,280

296
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:10,240
somewhere on the rising side. If we tap on 
the beta line 

297
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:14,559
at 8.3, which is somewhere around here, we 
get that the 

298
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,960
beta would be significantly higher than 
the alpha. 

299
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:23,159
But we know from theory that alpha is 
definitely at 

300
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,919
least three times larger than K_beta, so 

301
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,240
the Nickel is not exactly a good 
candidate. Let's look at 

302
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:36,559
copper. Copper has an alpha 

303
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:40,159
of 8.0, which is roughly around these 
parts, which is 

304
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,760
a little bit below the maximum. So 

305
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:48,960
a good candidate so far. And K_beta is 
coming in at 

306
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,960
8.9 according to the charts. So 

307
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:57,679
8.9, and it's already significantly 

308
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:02,520
lower than the alpha we were getting, and 
it fits 

309
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:06,159
the logic of the theory that the alpha 
line yield will be 

310
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,200
significantly higher than the beta. 

311
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:14,360
The third candidate that 

312
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,360
falls into this range is still zinc. 8.6, 
when we 

313
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,760
out to these places, that is, it's hard 

314
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:26,159
to explain why we have 

315
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:30,159
so many events, or 

316
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:33,480
occurrences, in front of the alpha line, 
and when we look at 9.6, which is 

317
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:38,679
the beta line, 

318
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:42,919
9.6 is already practically falling at the 
end of the peak, and 

319
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,880
so actually this candidate is also 

320
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,640

321
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:53,640
not as good for us as the copper 
candidate. The conclusion is that 

322
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:58,159
the element is copper. The second 
conclusion is that the K_alpha 

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,360
and K_beta lines of copper are fused into 
one 

324
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,640
big 

325
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:07,720
common peak, and there is no 
distinguishable 

326
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:11,840
individual group of events for the alpha 
and for the 

327
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,159
beta transition. So that would be to the 

328
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,919
copper 

329
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,559
sample number one. That way when you 

330
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,200
proceed to identify the other samples, you 
should 

331
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,679
be able 

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,520
to identify all of them. Finally, the last 

333
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:36,480
part, I'll stop with one more 

334
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,480
sample, number four. 

335
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:45,400
In a minute! Sample number four, I 

336
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,520
promised we'd take another look at it. Why 
is that? 

337
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,120
We can see it's 

338
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:57,679
labeled as a sum peak, and in it we see 
that we 

339
00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:02,039
have some two maxima, so we can 

340
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:05,200
expect that it's a fused peak, and the 
lower 

341
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:08,280
energy will be the maximum for alpha, the 
higher for 

342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,720
beta. So let's go look. If we look at 

343
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:17,440
the first peak, we get an energy of 

344
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:22,880
about 10.7. The second peak is 

345
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:26,919
12.6, give or take. And we'll keep 
looking. So 

346
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,960
we're looking at K_alpha. 10.7 is 
somewhere 

347
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,880
between germanium and 

348
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,159
arsenic. Which wouldn't be entirely 
comfortable with 

349
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,080
arsenic. But if we got 

350
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,159
10.6 for arsenic, we should have 

351
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,320
something at 11.7. 

352
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:53,039
If we look at what's at 

353
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,039
11.7, there's exactly a dent - there's a 
minimum at 11.7. 

354
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,799
So arsenic, if it's there, its beta line 
would be artificially shifted to 
enormously 

355
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:08,480
higher energies. If we're looking for a 
beta 

356
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:13,760
line, on the other hand, selenium fits 
very well there 

357
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:17,039
with its K_beta lines, but 

358
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,799
selenium's K_alpha line comes out at 11.1. 

359
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:25,240
And when we look where 11.1 is, 

360
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:29,320
again it comes out somewhere in the 
valley. 

361
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,799
So it can't be selenium either. In this 
case,

362
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:36,039
we don't find a combination of the 
K_alpha and 

363
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:40,880
K_beta lines that would fit the 

364
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:45,840
measured sample. So we try to 

365
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:49,240
go to the L. When we look for the L_alpha 
line, we're 

366
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,120
missing a page here, when we look for 

367
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,760
the L_alpha 

368
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,679
line, we're

369
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,000
looking for 

370
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,559
L_alpha. 

371
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,880


372 00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:08,520
10.7 is 

373
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:14,720
bismuth. K_alpha 10.8. Good candidate is 
still 

374
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:18,600
lead, 10.4, 10.5. Let's take a look at 

375
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:23,679
the beta. L_beta, 

376
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:29,679
we've got everything here at about 

377
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:34,640
12.3, 12.7 for lead, 12.6, 

378
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:38,400
12.6, and really 12.6 is the beta line 
that 

379
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,000
we're observing. For bismuth, it would be 
more like 

380
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,840
13.4. There's a 12.6 

381
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,960
four line but the beta lines are all 

382
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,559
around 13. When we look at where 

383
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,200
13 is, 

384
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:59,400
it's already a little bit past the peak. 

385
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,320
That means... Here's the 13, whereas here 

386
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,960
we've got the 12.6. That means 

387
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,799

388 00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,039
we can conclude for sample 

389
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,799
number four that it's either lead or 

390
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:17,080
bismuth. With a higher probability 

391
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:21,919
and a better fit to those lines for 

392
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:26,559
lead. So that's about it for this, and 

393
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:30,000
we'll probably not record any more 
information beyond that, and 

394
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,600
you'll be sent the data to 

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,520
try to process in that way, 

396
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,970
and to complete the other tasks that are 
asked of you.

397
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:57,320
