00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello, my name is Vojtěch Pleskot and 

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,120
I will guide you through the nuclear 
practical task A5 

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,400
Spectrometry of alpha radiation. We're 
just going to 

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,840
measure alpha radiation energies. 
Internally 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,039
, we call this problem a pot for 

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,760
obvious reasons 

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,039
. Well, in order to measure 

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,760
alpha radiation energy, we need two 

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,160
things: alpha radiation and a detector. 

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,679
The source of the alpha radiation is the 
isotope 

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,679
americium 241 

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,320
, and then in the second phase of the 
problem 

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
we'll also use plutonium. It's a mixture 
of 

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,879
two 

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,000
isotopes. Our detector is just that 

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,199
thing in the steel ring. 

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,520
It's a silicon chip. It is, as you can 
see, tiny. 

18
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,199
It's plenty big enough for our 

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,680
purposes. It's a thin wafer, and for our 

20
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,600
measurements, where we have alpha 
radiation with an energy of 

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,840
about 5 megaelectron volts, 

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,280
it would be enough, actually, to be 

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,759
30 micrometers thick , because that's the 
thickness of silicon 

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,960
in which alpha radiation can already 

25
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:15,360
be absorbed. Here, this is the 

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,759
radioactive source holder and we can move 
it 

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,439
back and forth 

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,320
. But we're not going to measure the 

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,280
distance between the detector and the 
emitter, because 

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,479
we'd have to 

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,439
move the emitter and that's not really 

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,320
practical. We're going to measure the 

33
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,600
pressure. The emitter will still be in the 
same place 

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,759
relative to the detector, but we'll 

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,520
change the pressure in the pot . And now 
we're going to be interested in 

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,640
ionization losses in air or the Bragg 

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
curve in 

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,040
air at atmospheric pressure. And it's 
clear 

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,159

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,159
that this parameter - the effective 
distance of 

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
the detector from the 

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,960
emitter for the case of atmospheric 
pressure - is clearly 

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,159
related to what pressure we have in the 
pot 

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,200
. Simply, the lower the pressure there, 
it' 

45
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,200
s as if the detector and the 

46
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,280
emitter are closer together at atmospheric 

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,519
pressure. So here's where 

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,239
we're going to read the silicon chip . So 
there's a wire leading from it to 

49
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,959
the 

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:28,120
digitizer. There the analogue signal - 
actually 

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,080
an electric current - is converted into a 
count on 

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,160
some kind of dial. So whenever 

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,239
an alpha particle passes through our 
silicon chip, it 

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
leaves a signal in the form of an 

55
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:45,640
electron-hole pair . 

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,200
We can read that as an electric current . 
It flows into our 

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,800
digitizer and 
then from the 

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,519
digitizer the converted signal 

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,840
goes into our computer 

60
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:05,280
and we can view it 

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,200
as a histogram on the screen using the MC2 
analyzer 

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,200
program. The key to our task will be to 

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,519
see how the alpha radiation interacts with 

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,480
the material. 

65
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,519
An alpha particle of our energy of 

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,400
about 5 megaelectron volts will 

67
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,480
ionize the material , which means that as it passes 
through it, it 

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,760
kicks electrons out of their orbitals and 

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,920
simply creates ions. The ionization 

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,000
losses of our alpha radiation are 
described by 

71
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,080
the Bethe-Bloch formula, which tells us 
how much 

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,879
an alpha particle of a given 

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,400
energy would leave in the material on 

74
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,599
average of its energy over a unit-length 
path 

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,760
. Ugh, that's complicated, huh? So once 
again, 

76
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,760
the Bethe-Bloch formula tells you how much 

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,480

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,560
energy an alpha particle of a given energy 

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,599
would leave in its unit-length path . 

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
Of course, the Bethe-Bloch formula is 

81
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,360
differential, so our particle doesn't have 
to 

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,560
travel a unit-length path. It only ever 

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,519
travels an infinitesimal bit, and then 

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,840
the value of the ionization loss changes 
again. 

85
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,440
The Bragg 

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:26,400
curve says something similar . It's 
completely analogous 

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:29,960
to the Bethe-Bloch curve. But the Bragg 
curve then 

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,360
tells you how much 

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,160
energy an alpha particle, which had a 

90
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:41,199
certain energy to begin with , will leave 
in the material 

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,160
if it has already traveled a path of a given length.

92
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,520
It is clear that you 

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
can go between the Bragg curve and the 
Bethe-Bloch curve by a simple 

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,160
conversion, because 

95
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,360
the Bethe-Bloch formula tells you how much 

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,720
ionization loss a particle of a given 

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,759
energy will do , and the Bragg curve tells 
you how much 

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,960
ionization loss 

99
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,199
a particle that has traveled a certain 
distance and 

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,240
had a given

101
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,080
energy at the beginning 
will do . So, if we know what 

102
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,759
energy it had at the beginning, and if we 
know what 

103
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,520
path it flew, we can calculate 

104
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,520
what energy it has now. The object of our 

105
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,039
measurement will be the Bragg curve, but 

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:28,800
we're not going to measure the distance 
the 

107
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:31,919
alpha particle flies. We'll instead 

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,400
measure the pressure 

109
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,600
in our 

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,639
pot. Clearly, if we know the pressure in 

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,680
our pot, that pressure is clearly 

112
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,600
related to the width of the air column 

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,800
between the detector and the 

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,199
emitter in case there is 

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,240
atmospheric 

116
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:01,759
pressure. Simply, the greater the 
pressure, 

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,479
effectively the wider the air column 

118
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,800
between the emitter and the 

119
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,400
detector. Now, let's have a look at 

120
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,400
the rest of the apparatus. Because in 
order to 

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,800
have low pressure somewhere , we have to 
pump out the 

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,720
air. We're going to 

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,160
use 

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,160
a vacuum pump to pump the air out . Okay, 
we're ready to take 

125
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,919
measurements. We'll put the alpha emitter 
in the holder. It's

126
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,919
americium 241. 

127
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,599
All right. 

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,199
It's at some fixed distance from the 

129
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:41,599
detector. 

130
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll tell you that distance later . We'll 
cover the 

131
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,560
pot and we can 

132
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
pump it out with the pump. 

133
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,970
[Music] 

134
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:05,560
We're seeing the pressure drop. 

135
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:07,879
[Music] 

136
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,039
So when we're at 

137
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:14,680
zero, we can 

138
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,400
turn the pump off and we have a nice, 
perfect 

139
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,800
vacuum in the pot . So now we have zero 

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,599
pressure in our pot . That means 

141
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,199
there's no air between the emitter and the 
detector. Let's take a 

142
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,199
calibration measurement. 

143
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,720
And we've got a nice 

144
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,800
histogram coming up . The way this 
histogram works is that 

145
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,319
when our detector detects 

146
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,159
an alpha 

147
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,800
particle, it sends a signal here. There 
it's 

148
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,919
converted to a channel number. 

149
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,720
The channel number goes to the 

150
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:04,240
computer, and when the computer sees 

151
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
the channel number , it 

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,400
adds 

153
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,360
a one to the corresponding x-axis bin . 
You can see that we're getting 

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,680
alpha particles here quite quickly, we're 
already at 

155
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,680
several thousand alpha 

156
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,879
particles. Now we're going to wait about 
10 

157
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:27,319
minutes until we get a decent statistics so 
we 

158
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:31,440
can determine the location of the 
americium peak 

159
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,440
and do a calibration. 

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,640
We've stopped the measurements. Now 
whenever 

161
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,519
an alpha particle comes into the detector, 

162
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,839
we ignore it and it 

163
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:05,160
doesn't contribute to our spectrum . We've 
collected a nice peak. 

164
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:09,800
It's an alpha peak from americium 241. 

165
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:13,880
We can see it here and use it 

166
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,760
to calibrate. Because in case there's no 

167
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,399

168
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,480
air between the emitter and the detector , 
we know perfectly well from the tables 

169
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,480
the energy at which this peak 

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:31,200
should sit. That is, we 

171
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,839
assign this energy to the appropriate 
channel 

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
and assign zero energy to the zero channel 

173
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,600
. Let's do this. 

174
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,600
Let's add a peak. 

175
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,800
Add a zero channel. 

176
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,560
Add the center of gravity of our peak. 

177
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Let's read from the tables its 

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,440
energy 5485 dot 

179
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,360
74 

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
keV. 

181
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,839
Ok enable 

182
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,079
calibration. You can see that now where 
the 

183
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,320
cursor is, that black line, it's 

184
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:39,839
no longer showing us the channel number, 
it's showing us the energy in 

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,800
kiloelectron volts. The calibration is 
done and 

186
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,399
now we can 

187
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,519
proceed to determine the resolution of our 

188
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:52,360
detector. So if we had a perfect 

189
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,279
detector, which always measures 
accurately, which 

190
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,040
always spits out as a number exactly the 

191
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,120
energy of the 

192
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,240
radiation, we wouldn't see a 

193
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,839
thick line. We'd see a thin 

194
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
line delta function. 

195
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,240
But we don't have a perfect detector. 

196
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,200
That's why it 

197
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,800
blurs the delta function with its 
resolution. 

198
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,800

199
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,440
So instead of a delta function 

200
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:27,200
, we just see a line that's quite thick. 

201
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:31,040
This entire object can be fitted 

202
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,120
to a Gaussian plus a second degree polynomial. 

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,240
The polynomial is there because in 
addition to our 

204
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,880
signal, which is alpha radiation from an 
americium 

205
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,519
of a given energy, we always have 

206
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,639
some 

207
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,959
background in the detector . So the 
polynomial fits the background. 

208
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:54,839
In the table, we can already see a nice 
indication 

209
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:59,760
of the peak. Its center, 

210
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:03,560
its width at half height, that's going to 
be an important quantity, its 

211
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,600
area -that means how many alpha 

212
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,440
particles we've 

213
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,720
detected in it . So now we've got the 

214
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,000
calibration done , we've got the data to 
determine the 

215
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,360
resolution of our detector, and we can 

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,040
proceed to measure the Bragg curve. 

217
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,839
So now I'm going to allow some air into 
the pot, 

218
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:27,040
increase the pressure in there, which 
effectively means 

219
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm increasing the width of the air column

220
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,920
between the radiation source and the detector. 

221
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,760
We'll take 10 such steps 

222
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,440
, and at each one we'll measure the 

223
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,199
position of our peak, which will move 

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,800
towards zero. The more air 

225
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:04,079
between the detector and the emitter, the 

226
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,079
more energy our alpha particles 

227
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,079
lose from the americium . 

228
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,880
So we're taking measurements. 

229
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,199
I'll stop the measurement now. 

230
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,959
I'll read the properties of our peak. 

231
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,079
I see that its center is at a different 
energy. 

232
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,770
I'm gonna let in more air and 

233
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:53,210
repeat. 

234
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:53,210
[Music] 

235
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,649
[Music] 

236
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,959
This will gradually give us 10 points in 
our 

237
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:20,199
curve of the 

238
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:22,399
alpha energy versus 

239
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,759
the thickness of the air column 

240
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,279
at atmospheric pressure between the 
detector and the 

241
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,279
emitter. 

242
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,759
Of course, what we're really measuring is, 
once 

243
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,120
again, the dependence of alpha radiation 
energy on 

244
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,120
air pressure. 

245
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,959
So we have another value, the 

246
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,959
sixth in order , to our dependence. 

247
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Seventh value. We keep 

248
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,720
moving the peak closer and closer to zero. 

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,560
Eighth value. 

250
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
[Music] 

251
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,080
[Music] 

252
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,529
[ Music] 

253
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,160
So now the measurement at the last 

254
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,759
pressure value - already at atmospheric pressure.

255
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,360
We've been going in 

256
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,959
steps from zero to atmospheric pressure 

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,959
, in increments of ten kilopascals. 

258
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,560
The last value measured. Now we have 

259
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,720
11 values in our table - for each 

260
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,319
value of air pressure. We went in 

261
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,560
steps of ten kilopascals, so for each 

262
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,560
pressure value we have the energy of our 
peak. 

263
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,600
From our table, we can easily 

264
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,440
calculate the magnitude of the ionization 
loss as a function of 

265
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,160
what air 

266
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,959
column our alpha particle had to 

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,040
pass through, or we have a measured Bragg 
curve. 

268
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,839
So that pretty much completes 

269
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,160
all but the last task. We're

270
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,319
going to plutonium. 

271
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,180
Let's swap americium for 

272
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,279
plutonium. 

273
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,279
[Music] 

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,600
And we'll be pumping air out again. 

275
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,240

276
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,320
And since our 

277
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,320
plutonium emitter is made of two 

278
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:09,280
isotopes, we'll see two peaks. 

279
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,840
And based on the activity of those peaks 
or - in other 

280
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,400
words, the amount of alpha particles in 

281
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:20,159
each of those peaks - and the lifetimes 

282
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,200
of the two plutonium isotopes, we'll 
determine the 

283
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,440
relative abundance of those isotopes in 

284
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,960
our sample. 

285
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,360
So we have a spectrum of plutonium. 

286
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Here we see a nice peak, a big one. 

287
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,919
Here's the other peak from the other 
isotope, small, but 

288
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,400
it's there. 

289
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,760
We label both peaks and we can read 

290
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,039
their areas along with the other 

291
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,039
data 

292
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:54,640
needed to determine the statistical error. 

293
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:57,720
So once again. Now we have the areas of 

294
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,919
two peaks from two isotopes of plutonium. 

295
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,559
From the tables, we find their 

296
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:07,600
lifetimes, or 

297
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,000
half-lives, and we can determine the 
relative 

298
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,559
abundance of these two isotopes in our 
plutonium sample. 

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,840
So with that, we've gone through 

300
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,640
all the steps that are done for problem 

301
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,000
number A5 Alpha Radiation Spectrometry. 

302
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,799
Unfortunately, you can't be here and do 

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,320
them yourself. 

304
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,960
It's sad, but in today's pandemic 
environment, there's nothing else you 

305
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,159
can do. By not being 

306
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,880
able to be here on site, you obviously 

307
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:38,120
can't measure your own data. 

308
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:41,799
You'll get them from us - a team of 
practitioners. 

309
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,480
I bid you farewell. I hope to 

310
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:48,480
see you live sometime. If not, good luck 

311
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,480
with the A5 task and the other tasks. 

312
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Goodbye!
