00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, my name is Standa Valenta and 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,719
today I will describe the task of A4 
Physics Lab 4 in Trója. 

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,759
This assignment is called Total 

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,279
effective gamma-ray cross section - 
measurement of 

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,400
gamma absorption coefficients. In this 

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,960
problem, we will be using a semiconductor 

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,480
germanium detector to measure the gamma 

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,560
spectrum from a 226 radium emitter, and we 
will be looking at 

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,439
how the individual peaks - the spectral 

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,680
lines of this emitter - attenuate as we 
add 

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,160
different materials. 

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,160
We have iron, 

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,160
lead 

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,480
and cadmium. Now we'd like to 

15
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:50,239
describe the measuring apparatus in more 
detail. 

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:55,840
Our emitter is located at the bottom of 
this 

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:01:00,480
cylinder - the lead shielding - in the 
center of it. 

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,559
The emitter is seen by the detector,

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,680
and between the emitter and the detector 
we have a 

20
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,799
sort of drawer into which we can 

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,960
- and will - gradually add the 

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,560
various materials of the shielding. 

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,920
The geometry is fixed so that the 
radiation actually 

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,840
passes through 

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,840
our shielding on the way to the detector. 

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,640
The first step will be to measure the 

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,119
spectrum without any shielding, which will 

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,079
also be used to calibrate our 

29
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,720
detector. We'll start the calibration 

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:44,280
measurements. 

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,759
A histogram will start filling the screen 
, where so far the 

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,399
bin number is characterized only by the 

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,000
channel number . Thus, this figure is not 
correct. 

34
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:58,159
Since the spectrum of radium 226 is very 

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,159
well measured and shows very 

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,840
specific, relatively intense transitions, 
we 

37
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,920
can use these to calibrate and thus 

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,680
convert from channel number to energy. 

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,680
However, we have to wait until we get the 
measurements.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,680


41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,770
[Music]

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,920
[Music] 

43
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,480
To evaluate this measurement, we certainly 

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,959
cannot do without measurements of the 
thicknesses 

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,280
of the absorbing materials. To do this, 

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:51,280
we use a caliper,

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,120
which students use 

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,440

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,159
to measure the thicknesses 

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,239
of the materials in between when the 
measurement is in progress and they are 
not evaluating it. 

51
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,040
We will supply these thicknesses along 
with the measured peak 

52
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,120
reports. It is good to remember that 

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,959
different materials have very different 

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,120
mechanical properties, and thus 

55
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,280
the systematic error in the thickness 
measurements is 

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,280
specific to each 

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,400
material. For example, 

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,239
I can't do much with iron plate, but it 
is already partially 

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,680
corroded. 

60
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,680
I can do quite 

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
a lot with those lead thin plates. 

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,120
This must be reflected in the analysis 
of 

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,400
our measured data. 

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
We could now proceed to 

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
evaluate the calibration spectrum 

66
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,000
we have just measured. 

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,319
I have marked the 

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,760
five 

69
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,439
most prominent peaks in a wide range of 

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,120
energies on the screen according to the 
attached known spectrum, and I 

71
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:05,000
will now tell the analysis program what 
energy to 

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,000
assign to which peak center of gravity, 
and convert the scale from channel to 
energy. 

73
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,110
[Music] 

74
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,400
After identifying the five most prominent 

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,160
peaks in the spectrum and assigning the 
energies,

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,919
we can call up the 

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,360
so-called peak report in the analysis 
program, where we can see 

78
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,560

79
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,560
the parameters of the peaks, which are 
generated by 

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:45,240
the analysis program by

81
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,360
fitting the histogram interval to the sum 
of a line and a Gaussian 

82
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,759
curve. So here in this 

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,919
table is the centroid, it's

84
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
assigned 

85
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,960
an energy, Full Width in Half Maximum, 

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:07,320
something that scales with the Gaussian 
sigma, and then 

87
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:11,400
the peak areas and the areas below the 
line, the 

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,400
peak area and naturally the uncertainty. 

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,919

90
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
So we have the spectrometer scale 
calibrated to kiloelectronvolt energies. 

91
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,880
Therefore, to perform well in 

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,280
this 

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:33,319
task, we need to cover as wide an 

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,600
energy interval as possible, and as 
uniformly as possible using 

95
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,440
sufficiently intense singlet 

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,199
peaks. 

97
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Thus, 

98
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,919
we label the peaks and 

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:50,000
save a new peak 

100
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:53,199
report with ten to fifteen peaks, which 
will 

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,280
serve as a 

102
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,639
zero-thickness measurement in addition to 
the calibration. We will remember to mark 
the 

103
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,360
natural background peak of potassium 40 

104
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,759
at an energy of about 1461 kiloelectronvolts. 

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,280
Since this transition does not come from 
the 

106
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,440
emitter, it 

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,280
will show a different, 

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,919
non-exponential dependence on the 
thickness. This is the 

109
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,919
subject of an investigation in one work 

110
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,919
problem. 

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,440
After saving the peak report,

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,000
we delete the spectrum, but keep the 

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,919
intervals marked in which 

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,919
the peaks we investigate grow. 

115
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,199
We add a shielding layer and turn on a 

116
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,199
new measurement. 

117
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,919
We will see that our peaks 

118
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,800
are indeed growing at the same intervals, 
and we 

119
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,919
can keep the labels we used. 

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,919
When the measurements run out, 

121
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,199
we let the analysis program 

122
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,599
evaluate the labeled regions again and 
save 

123
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
another peak report. We do this for 

124
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,080
suitably chosen 

125
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,720
thicknesses of each material. 

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,479

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
Typically around ten measurements in total. 

128
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,160

129
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,240
We can use the tables available 

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,840
in the physics lab to compare with the 
tabulated values. 

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,919

132
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:45,080
However, it is more practical in our 
situation to use a web-based database 

133
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,639
and a link to this database can be found 
in the 

134
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,639
task instructions. 

135
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,320
[Music] 

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,240
It is now clear that the data analysis will 

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,280
be done for each material and for each 

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,039
energy separately. Use 

139
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,840
a decreasing exponential as the fit function.

140
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,960
When fitting this 

141
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,560
exponential, it is a good idea to think 
about 

142
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,399
how the parameter N_0 

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:40,760
relates to the measured value of N 

144
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,839
counts in a given peak at zero shielding 
thickness. 

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,080
For the successful completion of the 
fourth 

146
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,080
task, which is actually related to a good 

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,279
discussion of the measured values, it is 
good to 

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,959
remember that we experimentally cannot 

149
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,839
distinguish the individual interactions. 

150
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,600
We can only look to see if 

151
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,720
our measured values of the absorption 

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
coefficients show some 

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,399
systematic trend that could 

154
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,120
be explained by 

155
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,160
individual interactions. 

156
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,120
At this point it is important to 

157
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,560
realize how which interaction does or does 

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,120
not change the energy of the photon. If a 
photon flies out of 

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,440
the 

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,440
emitter with a given energy and interacts 
with a photoeffect in the shielding, 

161
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:36,600
it is clear that it will not reach the 
detector. This situation is very 

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,760
different for both coherent and 

163
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,000
incoherent scattering. Please 

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:48,920
think about this and realize this. For this 
reflection 

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,399
it is good to know the dimensions of the 
apparatus. 

166
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,920
The characteristic distances 

167
00:09:51,399 --> 00:10:00,600
are such that the distance of the drawer 
in which 

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,000
we put the shielding 

169
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,279
is about 4 centimeters from the radiation 
source. 

171
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,920
That is, the distance from the bottom of 

172
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:13,240
this drawer. 

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,360
The distance from the detector, or the 

174
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,399
top of the detector, to the emitter 

175
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,560
is less than 11 centimetres. 

176
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:27,640
The diameter of the detector, or the metal 

177
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,920
casing of the detector, is just over 8 
centimetres. 

178
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,839
For qualitative considerations in the 
discussion, such 

179
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,440
rough data will suffice. 

180
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:43,079
No quantitative estimates are needed. 

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,240
The important thing is to 

182
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,160
make a correct self-critical assessment of 
whether 

183
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,399
or not we see a 

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
systematic trend in the measured values 
compared to 

185
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
the tabulated values. 

186
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,839
Dear students, 

187
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,880
it is a pity that you cannot 

188
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:04,200
personally measure the task in our 
physics lab, but 

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,959
I hope this video will serve 

190
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,880
as a full primer for you. 

191
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,959
I am fully available to help you 

192
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,800
via e-mail or at Zoom 

193
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,639
meetups. 

194
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,440
If you 

195
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,200
encounter any confusion during the 
data analysis, 

196
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,320
really feel free to contact me. 

197
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,600
Once again, my name is Standa Valenta and 

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,959
the e-mail address to write to can be 
found on 

199
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:41,320
our website ipnp.cz. 

200
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,320
Good luck and stay safe!
