A2 Study of gas detectors 

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,719
Hello, my name is Ingrid Knapová, 

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,360
we are in the nuclear physics practice 

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,679
in Troja and I will guide you through the 
A2 task, which is 

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,679
the study of gas detectors. 

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,920
The Ionization Chamber Apparatus 

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,439
I will now introduce you to 

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,000
the apparatus that we will be using in the 
first 

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
part of this measurement. It is 

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
a picoampermeter, which will serve as a 

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
voltage source, and we will also use it 
to measure 

11
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,160
ionization currents, and connected to it,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,960
according to the diagram in the study 
text, is an ionization 

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
chamber. The ionization chamber is 
actually an 

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,600
air capacitor. It has two electrodes, 

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,360
one of which is sliding, and I can 

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,160
adjust the distance between them to 

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,160
1 to 6 cm. 

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,800
We have two emitters. Both of them 

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,239
are plutonium 239, and they have different 

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,320
activity, and our first task is to 

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,799
find out by measurement which of these 
emitters is 

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,000
more active. We do this by taking 

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,320
one of them and placing it on the plate of 

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,200
the condenser. Alpha particles 

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,520
pass through the air, they ionize 
along the way, they 

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,360
form cation-electron pairs, and if we have 

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,799
some non-zero voltage applied, 

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,439
these ion pairs are sucked to 

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
the electrodes and we can measure the 

30
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,320
ionization current, and this ionization 
current is 

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,479
proportional to the activity of 

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:44,200
the emitter. I set a distance of 6 cm and 

33
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,520
a voltage of 500 V. And why these 

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,200
values? That's what you'll find out if you 

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,200
stay with us.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,680
So on the display we now see the 

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,039
set voltage, which is 500 V, and the 
measured 

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,600
ionisation current in nanoamps. So 
something like 

39
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,560
12.4 picoamps 

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,920
in this case.

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,239
We can see that this current fluctuates 
quite strongly. 

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,239
You can think about why that is, 

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,440
or compare the magnitude of those 
fluctuations to the instrument error. 

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,480
Replace the emitters and repeat the same 

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,760
measurement for the other one. Now we see 

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,120
that for the other emitter the values of 
the 

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,120
ionization current are much smaller. 

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Measure the V-A characteristics of the 
ionization chamber in the range 0-500 V at 
different electrode distances of 1-6 cm. 
Use the more intense emitter. 
Determine the characteristic areas of the 
V-A dependence. Determine the optimum 
voltage and the optimum electrode spacing 
of the ionisation chamber. 

49
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,920
In problem number two, we are to measure 
the voltammogram 

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,800
characteristic for a more intense emitter. 

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,440
That is, we are going to set the voltage 

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,840
in the range from 0 to 500 V and we are 
going to measure the 

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,879
ionization current similarly to the one in 
the first 

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,480
problem. And by looking at the measured 
curve,

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,200
we can see why we 

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,080
just used a voltage of 500 V for problem 
number one. 

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,280
We'll do this for two different 

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,519
plate distances, for a distance of 2 cm 
and 6 cm. 

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
Alpha particles have a range in the air on 
the order of 

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,239
centimetres, so with the help of our 

61
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
apparatus, where we can vary the distance 
of 

62
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,360
the plates, we can estimate the range of 
the 

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,200
plutonium alpha particles by measurement. 
We do this by 

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,200
placing the emitter on a plate, setting a 

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,120
constant voltage, again 500 V, and 

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,760
measuring the ionisation current at 
different 

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,640
plate spacings. We can go from 1 to 6 cm 

68
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,799
in 1 cm increments. 

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,920
If we plot the dependence of the 

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,280
ionization current on the distance of the 
plates, we 

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,879
can 

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,239
estimate the range of plutonium-239 alpha 
particles 

73
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,480
in the air from the shape of this 
dependence. And it will also be 

74
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,840
clearer to us why we 

75
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,960
used a distance of 6 cm for problem number 
one. 

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,960
Measure the distance of the leakage 
current from the voltage in the range 
0-500 V at the optimum electrode spacing. 

77 00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,599
It would be interesting to see what we measure if

78
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,680
no emitter is placed inside.

79
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,599

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,879
So I can try to take this 

81
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,640
emitter out, put it back in the box, 

82
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:15,440
see that there's nothing inside, set the 

83
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,279
voltage again, say 500 V,

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:28,720
and start the measurement. 

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:31,039
[Music] 

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
We can see that even though there is 

87
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,600

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,759
no emitter placed in the ionization 
chamber, the current that we are 
measuring is not 

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,500
zero. You can think about that, why that is. 

90
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,550

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,550
Measure the activity ratio of the attached 
emitters, estimate their absolute 
activities (the mean energy to form an ion 
pair in air is 35 eV). 
Determine the range of alpha particles in 
the air. 

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,759
One of our next tasks is to 

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,039
estimate the absolute activities of the 
two 

94
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,639
emitters. We know that the measured 
ionization current 

95
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:01,479
is made up of electrons produced by 

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,600
ionization of the alpha particle in the 

97
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,680
air. If we know the energy required 

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,000
to form one ion 

99
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,840
pair, and we know the kinetic energy of 

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,520
the alpha particles flying out, we can 

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,880
calculate how many ion pairs are formed 

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,880
as one alpha particle flies by before it 
stops.

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,319
This information, together 

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,319
with the measured flux,

105
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,639
should be enough for us to 

106
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,639
estimate the absolute activity under 
simplified conditions. 

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,919
However, this simplistic reasoning does 
not take into account the 

108
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,360
geometric factor - that we are 

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,120
not detecting all the alpha particles 

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,240
that are emitted from this source. We can 
see that it 

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,280
is in a protective envelope, so 

112
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,400
we don't detect 

113
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,360
anything at all within this half-space 
angle. We're putting it on one 

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,639
electrode like that, so we're actually 
detecting less than half of the alpha 
particles that are emitted. 

115
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,560
Actually, it's still less than half the 
solid 

116
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,880
angle because of the way the emitter is in 
the 

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,120
containment or because of the 

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,970
geometrical arrangement of the apparatus, 
but 

119
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,529
for our purposes the factor of one half is 
sufficient. 

120
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,529
The Geiger-Mueller detector apparatus 

121
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,919
So these were the tasks related to the 

122
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,880
ionization chamber. In the second part 

123
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,080
we will discuss the characteristics of the 
Geiger-Mueller 

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,840
detector. We will again 

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,560
use the same plutonium 239 emitter and 
work 

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,400
with a different apparatus. We have a 

127
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,759
Geiger-Mueller detector at our disposal. 

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,400
The ORTEC voltage source will be connected 
to it, and 

129
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,440

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,360
we will examine the signal from the 
Geiger-Mueller detector on an 
oscilloscope. We will now take a 

131
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,479
closer look at the Geiger-Mueller 
detector. 

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,039
It is made up of two electrodes. Inside is a

133
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,520
thin wire, this is the anode. The cathode is

134
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,520
this cylinder around and it's filled with 
an inert 

135
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,400
gas. We put the Geiger-Mueller detector in 

136
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,759
the apparatus, 

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,759
put a protective 

138
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,680
cover on it, and put the alpha emitter on 
top. 

139
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,840
The alpha particles that are emitted from 
the emitter 

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,479
will ionize the environment, and the 

141
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,639
same effects will occur as in the 
ionization chamber. 

142
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,400
Using an oscilloscope, measure the 
dependence of the amplitude of the 
electrical pulse of the Geiger-Mueller 
(GM) detector on the voltage in the range 
0-1500 V. 

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,879
Turn on the voltage source and turn on the 
oscilloscope to 

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,680
look at 

145
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:39,800
the signals, and measure the voltammogram.

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Technically, this will be a 

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,759
volt-volt characteristic, because on the 

148
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,000
oscilloscope we'll see the signals in 

149
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,560
units of voltage, in volts, but since 

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,720
we know that the internal resistance of 
this 

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,400
oscilloscope is 1 megaohm, we 

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,599
can use Ohm's law to 

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,879
back-calculate that voltage to current. 
However, we're

154
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,400
not concerned with the absolute values of

155
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,080
that current in this problem, we're just 
concerned with the shape of that 

156
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
characteristic so that we can 

157
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,680
compare it,

158
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,720
so that's why we don't mind this. 

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,080
What happens when we set the voltage 

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,080
to 100 V? 

161
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,319
Nothing. 

162 00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,720
What happens when we set the voltage to 200 V?

163
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,159
Still nothing. 

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,460
And this will continue 

165
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:45,669
until the voltage is approximately 800 V. 

166
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:45,669
The million-dollar question. 
What happens at 800 volts? 
A) Nothing
B) The oscilloscope explodes
C) Donald Trump's head explodes

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,080
At 800 V we start to see some first 
signals. 

168
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,079
On the oscilloscope screen we see the 

169
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,760
time waveform of the signal from the 
Geiger-Mueller detector, which 

170
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,959
corresponds to the passage of an alpha 
particle through 

171
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,360
the medium. This is how we measure the 
whole voltammogram.

172
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,720
We always set the 

173
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,040
voltage at the source and read the 

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,959
amplitude of the signal on the 
oscilloscope. Now we set the 

175
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,160
voltage to the maximum, at 1500 V, and we 
see that 

176
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,519
even for this maximum value the amplitudes of

177
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,560
the signals are not the same. 

178
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,360
This information, together with a 

179
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,680
comparison with the theoretical dependence,

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
will help us to identify 

181
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,880
the characteristic region of the 
voltammetric dependence. 

182
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,200
Unfortunately you 

183
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
were not able to measure this task 

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,600
yourself due to the current situation, 
but we hope you at least enjoyed 

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600
this short introduction to the secrets of 
gas 

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
detectors.
