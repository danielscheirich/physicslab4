    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The oldest and still most common methods for measuring and comparing the activities of radioactive\n",
    "emitters are based on the ionizing effects of radiation in gases. Gases become conductive\n",
    "when ionizing radiation passes through them. If an ionizing particle enters the space between the plates\n",
    "of a capacitor to which voltage is applied, it creates positive and negative ions\n",
    "or free electrons along its path, which are set in motion by the electric field toward\n",
    "the electrodes, and an ionizing current passes between the capacitor plates. The ionization current depends\n",
    "on the intensity of the ionizing radiation, the energy of the ionizing particles, and the voltage between the plates\n",
    "of the capacitor. Since ionization losses depend on the type of ionizing particle and its initial\n",
    "energy, the described device can be used to distinguish between different types of particles or between\n",
    "energies of identical types of radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of a gas detector\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependence of the ionization current on the voltage between the detector electrodes, i.e., the characteristics of the chamber, is\n",
    "important for selecting the method and conditions of detector operation. In normal cases, at\n",
    "constant intensity of ionizing radiation, it shows a typical dependency that can be divided into the following\n",
    "areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ohm's law region. If no voltage is applied to the detector electrodes,\n",
    "no electric current flows through the chamber. The ions and electrons created by radiation completely\n",
    "recombine or diffuse outside the active region of the detector. Applying a small\n",
    "voltage leads to the separation of free charge carriers of opposite signs. The speed of their\n",
    "movement to the corresponding electrodes is directly proportional to the intensity of the electric field.\n",
    "The ionisation current therefore increases in direct proportion to the voltage.\n",
    "- As the voltage increases, the charge carriers are drawn more quickly to the electrodes, the\n",
    "number of ions in the active area decreases, and thus the chance of their recombination also decreases. The proportionality\n",
    "of the current to the voltage ceases to apply. The increase in current with voltage slows down.\n",
    "- The saturated current region is characterised by a constant ionisation current value,\n",
    "independent of voltage. At sufficiently high voltage, the recombination rate is suppressed\n",
    "to a negligible level and all free charge created by ionisation contributes\n",
    "to the ionisation current. Further increases in voltage cannot lead to an increase in current,\n",
    "as all free charge has already been collected and the rate of charge creation is constant. This\n",
    "region is typical for the operation of ionisation chambers.\n",
    "- Gas/avalanche amplification region. On their way to the electrodes, ions and electrons\n",
    "undergo numerous collisions with neutral molecules/atoms of the detector's gas filling.\n",
    "At sufficiently high electric field intensity (106 V/m for typical gases),\n",
    "the electrons gain energy between collisions that is higher than the ionisation energy.\n",
    "In the subsequent collision, they can then form a new ion pair. The secondary ion pair is\n",
    "then also accelerated by the electric field and creates further ion pairs. In this way,\n",
    "so-called avalanche amplification occurs, where each electron released in the primary ionisation\n",
    "by radiation generates a certain amount of secondary free electrons contributing\n",
    "to the electric current.\n",
    "- Proportionality region. In this region, gas amplification is independent of primary\n",
    "ionisation. The ionisation current is therefore proportional to the number of ion pairs created by the direct\n",
    "action of radiation, i.e. also to the total loss of radiation energy in the chamber.\n",
    "- Limited proportionality region. As the voltage increases further, it becomes apparent that\n",
    "while free electrons reach the anode very quickly, positive ions hardly move from their point of origin during\n",
    "the same time and slowly drift towards the cathode. If\n",
    "the concentration of positive ions in the detector volume is sufficiently high, they represent\n",
    "a space charge that significantly reduces the intensity of the electric field. This\n",
    "weakens further gas amplification and disrupts the proportionality between the signal and\n",
    "primary ionisation. It is still true that more energy deposited in the detector corresponds to\n",
    "a larger signal, but it is no longer directly proportional.\n",
    "- Geiger-Müller (GM) region. At sufficiently high voltage, the avalanche develops only\n",
    "until the emerging positive space charge reduces the intensity of the\n",
    "electric field to a level where gas amplification can no longer occur.\n",
    "At that point, all detector pulses have the same amplitude, independent of the type and\n",
    "energy of the radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of gas detectors\n",
    "\n",
    " A whole range of instruments designed to measure nuclear radiation are based on ionisation. Different\n",
    "characteristics of the described device utilise different types of gas computers. The area of\n",
    "Ohm's law is not suitable for particle detection because the resulting ionisation currents are very\n",
    "small and their magnitude is sensitive to the applied voltage.\n",
    " The saturated current area, where ionisation chambers operate, is much more advantageous for particle detection.\n",
    " In this area, the ionisation current passing through the chamber is independent of the magnitude of the\n",
    "applied voltage, and particles with different energies are easily distinguishable. The disadvantage\n",
    "of ionisation chambers is that the ionisation currents are still very small, resulting in demands on\n",
    "subsequent electronic processing, namely significant linear amplification, low noise levels, and\n",
    "the like.\n",
    " This region is followed by the region of proportional counters. Their great advantage is\n",
    "so-called gas amplification, which reaches three to five orders of magnitude. These counters utilise an increase in the\n",
    "number of ions in the gas filling through secondary ionisation in collisions. Because the dependence of the ionisation current on the applied voltage is very steep in this area,\n",
    "proportional counters require a very well-stabilised voltage source for proper operation.\n",
    "At the upper edge of the proportionality region, the so-called limited proportionality region, the\n",
    "characteristics of the chamber for different types of particles begin to converge, and this part of the region is\n",
    "practically not used.\n",
    "The end point of the proportionality range, where the characteristics of the chamber for different types of particles\n",
    "converge at a single point, is known as the Geiger threshold. Geiger-Müller counters operate above this threshold. Their advantage is high gas amplification. However, Geiger-Müller counters\n",
    "cannot distinguish between the energies or types of particles in the incident radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ionisation chamber\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used chambers are static low-pressure chambers with constant ionisation [1]. These are\n",
    "essentially gas (air) condensers. The effect of ionising radiation maintains a constant ionisation current, which discharges the chamber, and the magnitude of the ionisation current is\n",
    "measured in a suitable manner. Only with very powerful emitters is it possible to measure this current with a highly\n",
    "sensitive galvanometer. An electrometer is usually used to detect the change in voltage over time.\n",
    "When working with an ionisation chamber, either a pulse or integral connection can be used. In the first\n",
    "case, either a current or, more advantageously, a voltage pulse is sensed from a resistor connected to the\n",
    "chamber's power supply circuit, amplified and recorded. Ionisation chamber in integral connection\n",
    "as an ionising radiation dose detector. In this case, a voltage U is applied to the capacitor representing\n",
    "the ionisation chamber and a charge Q = CU is applied to it, where C is the constant capacitance\n",
    "of the capacitor. Ionising particles pass through the effective volume of the chamber, leaving behind\n",
    "ions that are carried to the electrodes, where their charge is neutralised. This results in\n",
    "a transfer of charge between the electrodes of the capacitor and the capacitor discharges. Since the capacitance\n",
    "of the capacitor is constant in this arrangement, the voltage drop corresponds to the radiation dose\n",
    "registered by the chamber. The time change in voltage across the capacitor then corresponds to the intensity\n",
    "of the registered radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under normal conditions, the air in the ionisation chamber is not a perfect insulator. Due to this\n",
    "and due to cosmic radiation or trace amounts of radioactive elements that are\n",
    "present in all substances, the chamber discharges. Although this so-called leakage current is very\n",
    "small, it is comparable to the ionisation current. Therefore, the resulting measurements must always be corrected for\n",
    "this effect.\n",
    " Although ionisation chambers are fundamentally the same for detecting different types of radiation,\n",
    "they differ in design. Alpha particles originating from naturally radioactive samples have a short range in air.\n",
    "For example, the range of the most energetic alpha particles emitted from the radioactive isotope\n",
    "polonium $^{212}\\mathrm{Po}$, which have a kinetic energy of $T_0 = 8.776 MeV$, is less than 9 cm in air under normal\n",
    "conditions. Therefore, alpha emitters are placed inside a cylindrical chamber with a\n",
    "diameter of about 18 cm so that most alpha particles leave their energy in the chamber.\n",
    " Since the range of beta particles from naturally radioactive samples in air under normal\n",
    "conditions is several metres, ionisation chambers for registering beta radiation are constructed to be as large as possible. Even\n",
    "so, only a fraction of the electrons are absorbed in the effective space of the chamber, and this device is most often\n",
    "used for comparative measurements for the same types of particles with the same energy.\n",
    " The direct ionisation of air by γ radiation is very small. Therefore, the design of ionisation chambers for\n",
    "γ radiation is significantly different from the previous two devices. \n",
    "The emitter is located outside the chamber, and\n",
    "the chamber walls act as a converter of γ radiation into electrons. Since the probability of interaction\n",
    "of gamma radiation with matter increases with the proton number of the substance, chambers with thick walls\n",
    "made of lead, steel or brass are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Experimental setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of study are two gas detectors – a plate ionisation chamber with adjustable electrode distance\n",
    "and a GM detector. Both detectors are connected to the same connector. However, the functions of this\n",
    "connector differ when connecting an ionisation chamber or GM detector. The connector diagram is shown in\n",
    "Fig. 2.\n",
    "A KEITHLEY 6487 picoammeter is used to measure the ionisation current. This\n",
    "device has a built-in 0-500 V voltage source. See Fig. 3 for the connection diagram. The voltage is set\n",
    "using the buttons on the front panel of the device in the V-SOURCE area. Use the up and down arrows to\n",
    "select the voltage value. Pressing the OPER button activates the set voltage and\n",
    "simultaneously illuminates the VOLTAGE SOURCE OPERATE indicator. Pressing the OPER button again\n",
    "deactivates the voltage and turns off the indicator.\n",
    "A NEMEC 0-2000 V high-voltage source is used to study the GM detector. When\n",
    "measuring, do not exceed a voltage of 1500 V to avoid destroying the GM detector! The amplitude\n",
    "of the pulses is measured using an oscilloscope with an input resistance of $1 \\mathrm{M}\\Omega$. See\n",
    "Fig. 4 for the connection diagram.\n"
