00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,639
Hello and welcome to the Trója part of 

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,200
Practitioner 4! My name is Hedvika 
Gedeonová

3
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:15,440
and I'm Tadeáš Dohnal and together 

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,600
we will take you through problem number 8 
of beta radiation absorption.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,960
I will be your model student and I will 
be 

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,920
your teacher. Also the one who corrects 
the 

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,920
protocols. Let's do it! 

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,600
First, let's take a look at our 

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,879
apparatus. Here at the bottom is our 

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,480
radiator. This is strontium 90, a beta 

11
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,719
emitter, which emits beta radiation or 

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,680
electrons. And as you can see, there's a 

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,359
hole drilled in the plastic here to 

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,079
direct the electrons 

15
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,079

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,840
upwards in a fairly narrow beam. Well, 
here we have the Geiger-Mueller detector. 

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,159
Is that the thing they were walking around 

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
Chernobyl with? How it clicked and 
they measured the 

19
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,159
radioactivity? It's basically the same 
type of 

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,520
detector, except this one 

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,280
doesn't click. The signal from the 
Geiger-Mueller 

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,240
detector goes through here to the 
analyser, which 

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,040
processes the signal and then passes 

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,000
the information to the computer about how 
many 

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
electrons or other background signals 
we've detected.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,479


27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,360
In the first part of this problem,

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,799
we'll look at the characteristics of the 
Geiger-Mueller 

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,439
detector. Here I've borrowed 

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,560
a specimen from another assignment. If you 

31
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,799
look, you might see that there's

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,719
a thin wire in the middle that forms 
the anode, and then 

33
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:06,880
around the sort of cylinder surface or 
that shell 

34
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:09,720
forms the cathode. We're going to apply a 
voltage to those and we 

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
want to actually measure how many of those 
signals 

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,319
we're going to see depending on that 
applied 

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,080
voltage. So we're going to vary the 
voltage and measure the 

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,400
number of signals and the goal is to 
determine the 

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,920
voltage that's optimal for the next 

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,760
measurement. Now we'll set the measurement 
time to 

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:35,160
20 seconds, then the spectrum and plateau 
option, and from 

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:37,480
400 V to 800 V in 5 V increments. In 
total, it 

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,599
will take almost half an hour, but it will 

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,599
actually measure the whole thing by 
itself. 
Half an hour? 

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,879
In the second part of this problem, we're 
going to measure 

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,360
the actual absorption 

47
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,920
curve. We have these small metal plates for this here. 

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,080
If you look, it says areal density. 

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,280
Of course, they're made of aluminum, which 
isn't exactly the 

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,440
hardest metal, and they've been around for 
years. 

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,480
So they may be a little tatty. 

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:14,239
We'll take the small metal plate, put it between the 

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,440
emitter and the detector and close the 
door. 

54
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,680
Close the door? Just now? Then I'm already 

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,799
irradiated anyway, right? 

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,879
The emitter's probably not that strong. 
It's more about 

57
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,480
not picking up any background from 
outside. 

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,400
And we were okay with that first job? 

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Well, we were concerned with how the 

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
number of signals varied with voltage, but 
we didn't

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,840

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,120
really care what the origin of the 
signal was. Now we'd just want 

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,519
the electrons or the beta 

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:49,599
radiation from the strontium if possible. 

65
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,560
So we'll close the door, we'll start 
taking measurements, each measurement will 
be 

66
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:58,040
100 seconds long, and when it runs out, 
we'll 

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,599
open the door again and insert another 
small plate. 

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,799
We'll try not to 

69
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,319
move the previous plates, and we'll just 
keep 

70
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,439
putting more and more plates in. 

71
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,159
We're not going to take them out just for 

72
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,360
consistency of geometry. And then when we 
put in 

73
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,040
all the ones described, then at the end, 
we'll 

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,639
add this 

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,280
thick one, which no electron 

76
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,479
from strontium should go through anymore. 
But that doesn't mean 

77
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,280
we won't see any signal, because 

78
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,080
electrons can also bounce off the 

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,880
chamber wall and arrive at the detector 
without 

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,360
ever having to go through the absorber. 

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,840
So in that sense, some experimental 

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,840
background will probably still be there. 

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,240
The third part of the measurement will be 
done 

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,680
again without the 

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,199
absorber. We will take a total of 765 
measurements, 

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,840
each with a duration of 1 second. In each 

87
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,560
measurement, we'll measure the number of 
electrons from 

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,000
strontium decay that have reached the 

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,039
detector. And the goal is to see whether 

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,280

91
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:09,120

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,000
or not the number of electrons from those 
measurements is distributed according to a 
Poisson distribution, as we would expect. 

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,759
I hope you enjoyed our tutorial, and I'll

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,960
see you again after the coronavirus! 
I look forward to 

95
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
seeing your protocols!
